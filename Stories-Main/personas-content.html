                        <h3>Personality</h3>
                        <p>Zahrya’s personality is... Unique, to say the least. She is really energetic, often alternating between multiple topics really fast. While her intentions are always good, her focus can be fleeting, though she's also capable of intense concentration when something truly captures her interest. Social interactions can be a bit of a stumbling block for her, despite her genuine efforts to connect with others. Nuances and subtle hints often fly right over her head; directness is definitely the key to her understanding. Yet, through it all, Zahrya radiates an infectious enthusiasm and a bright, unwavering optimism, rarely seen without a smile gracing her lips.</p>

                        <h3>Backstory</h3>
                        <p>Zahrya was born from the very magic that flowed withing an ancient cherry grove. For quite some time, the wilderness was her cradle, as she was taken in and raised by the foxes that inhabited the forest, learning how to survive all challenges, how to hide in the face of danger and how to hunt efficiently for plenty food and as years passed, the foxes believed se was ready to walk her own path and left her. </p>
                        
                        <p>Throughout time, her curiosity only grew more and more, she was filled with wonder for the world around her, specially feeling some type of special connection with nature (Even more with cherry trees) and wanting to know more. One day, in her own adventures, she discovered that there existed a Village nearby that she never noticed before. Filled with curiosity, she cautiously integrated herself, adopting the identity of a long lost traveler that originally was passing by. Slowly, she earned the trust of the villagers, sharing her hunting skills and eagerly learning their language and the ways of cultivating the land.</p>

                        <p>Sadly, her peaceful life would be shattered one fateful day when a medieval army, fueled by a king’s greed and hunger for power, descended upon the village while burning everything in their path, including the forest. Instinctively, Zahrya rose to defend both the people who had welcomed her and the magical grove that was her birthplace. In that moment of desperate need, her powers, unknown even to herself, erupted as thorny vines adorned with delicate cherry blossoms which launched towards the soldiers, surprising them and making her a tough obstacle but, though her heart was fierce, her inexperience in combat and the overwhelming tide of her emotions led to her capture.</p>

                        <p>After her defeat, she was taken to the conquering kingdom's laboratories, becoming a subject of cruel experimentation.</p>

                        <p>Scientists wanted to extract he source of her unique abilities no matter what. One day, while wielding magical staffs to suppress her, they used  a dangerous substance known as Aetherium Crysalis, a mix of potent magical crystals. When injected into her eyes, she suffered an agonizing process that made the material fuse with her eyes, specially the irises, which left her vision impaired but transformed her once natural irises into striking square yellow eyes with heart-shaped pupils and granted her the strange ability to perceive magical auras and maintain an unmovable  focus on her targets.</p>

                        <p>Following this horrific transformation, Zahrya was forced into the role of a battle slave, subjected to torturous training for the entertainment. Despite this, a spark of defiance ignited within her, manifesting as snow-related powers. To suppress this resistance, the kingdom administered a mind-weakening drug that also caused her hair to gradually lose its natural color, turning a soft pastel pink with each dose and even white in some areas.</p>

                        <p>It was only through sheer luck and the intervention of a mysterious girl, who infiltrated the laboratories and vanished without a word after freeing her, that Zahrya finally escaped her captivity.</p>

                        <h3>Additional Info</h3>
                        <p>During her time as a slave, between the weapons of her oppressors, Zahrya encountered a massive, spiked mace. Likely a prized possession of a fallen champion from the army that destroyed her home, the weapon resonated with her unique magical signature and the pain she had endured. It developed a consciousness and formed a peculiar bond with her, acting as a blunt, protective, and stern older sibling, offering both unwavering support and dryly sarcastic commentary as she navigates the world.</p>

                        <p>Despite the formidable weapon she wields and the hardships she has faced, Zahrya harbors a deep disgust to violence, resorting to it only when absolutely necessary.</p>

                        <h3>Personality</h3>
                        <p>Sydca is a very cautious person. This comes from how fragile her ink body is and the bad experience she had in the past. She tends to approach new situations and people carefully, often watching from a distance before getting involved. This carefulness isn't because she's mean, but more of a natural way to protect herself, especially since she constantly has to work to keep her body together.</p> 
                        <p>Even with her cautious nature, Sydca is also very curious. She has a quiet desire to understand the world around her. She pays close attention to details that others might miss. This curiosity shows when she listens carefully and asks thoughtful, though not many, questions. She finds new and unusual things interesting, even if her hesitation often fights with her wish to explore them.</p>
                        <p>A big part of Sydca's personality is how embarrassed she feels about the marks and cracks on her left side. Th   ese imperfections are always there, reminding her that she's vulnerable and what happened to her. She tries hard to hide them, often standing or sitting in a way that keeps her left side hidden. If someone asks about the marks, she gets very uncomfortable, becoming even quieter than usual. She'll give short, unclear answers or try to change the subject, showing how insecure she feels and how much she doesn't want to show this part of herself.</p>

                        <h3>Backstory</h3>
                        <p>Sydca came to be in a bright and busy cartoon world. In that place, characters usually had strong, clear shapes. But Sydca was different; she was made entirely of living ink. Right from when she started existing, Sydca was much weaker physically than others in her world. While other cartoon characters were naturally tough, Sydca's ink form was always a bit less steady, more likely to shimmer or fade a little compared to the solid shapes of her friends</p>

                        <p>Because she was always a bit fragile, her early life wasn't normal. Even though she joined in with daily life, people often treated her very gently, sometimes even feeling sorry for her. Things that were easy for others were hard for her. She found it tough to keep her exact shape or do anything physical without feeling her body start to weaken. This constant, quiet fight just to be solid in her own body made her feel different. This basic physical weakness from her cartoon world is the main reason why, now, keeping her ink form together is such a never-ending and difficult task.</p>

                        <p>Sydca's world, and indeed her very being, was originally created by a magic artist. This artist drew and wrote all the stories and characters, just like old cartoons are made on paper. For a long time, everything was peaceful and well-drawn. However, one day, the artist decided to stop working on Sydca's world. They simply stored away the papers that made up her reality, putting them somewhere out of sight.</p>

                        <p>It was during this time, while her world was tucked away, that something terrible happened. Accidentally, some of the papers that held Sydca's world were torn. These tears weren't just simple rips; they caused parts of her cartoon reality to become corrupted and unstable. Sydca, being made of ink and already fragile, was caught directly in this disaster. One of these destructive tears directly hit her left side. The impact left deep, raw marks—not just surface wounds, but actual cracks and fissures that ripple through her ink body. These aren't like normal injuries; they are ongoing breaks in her very being, a visible sign of the damage done to her world.</p>

                        <p>Ever since, these marks have been a constant drain. Sydca has tried countless times to mend them, pouring her precious energy into sealing the cracks and making her left side whole again. But because the damage comes from a tear in her very reality, fixing them perfectly requires an immense amount of energy – energy she simply cannot spare without risking her entire form dissolving. The constant effort just to keep them from spreading or worsening is the additional reason why maintaining her form is so incredibly difficult now, forcing her left eye, in particular, to appear darker as the ink struggles to hold itself together there.</p>

                        <h3>Additional Info</h3>
                        <p>As a being made of living ink, Sydca has a unique way of staying whole. She slowly (very slowly) consumes ink from her surroundings to keep her body from dissolving. Any ink she gathers is directly used to help her maintain her form and, if possible, attempt to heal herself. This process is a constant, subtle drain, and finding enough pure ink to help with her more serious damage is a challenge.</p>

                        <p>Beyond just holding herself together, Sydca can also control her ink body in versatile ways. She can reshape parts of herself, forming them into flexible, liquid appendages or even tentacle-like extensions. This allows her to interact with her environment in ways a solid body cannot, whether for movement, grasping objects, or even defense.</p>

                        <p>Her eyes, though visually striking with their rainbow colors, offer more than just beauty. Sydca possesses an enhanced sense of sight, allowing her to see far beyond what normal eyes can perceive. She can see into both the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) spectrums, revealing hidden heat signatures or light patterns. This gives her a unique perspective on the world.</p>

                        <p>Notably, her left eye, the one on her damaged side, sometimes glows softly. This subtle luminescence is not just a visual quirk; it's a direct sign of her body's struggle and attempts to repair itself. The glow often intensifies when she is pushing her energy to maintain her form or when she is actively, though often unsuccessfully, trying to mend the deep cracks from the artist's tear. It's a hint of the ongoing, internal healing process that's constantly at work.</p>
